# HIT238 - Reduce page size
A modified version of the [Start Bootstrap - Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) theme with room for optimisation

## Activity
Open the original page in Chrome developer tools and look at the network size. [Throttle your network](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#throttling) to a slow 3G connection and see how long it takes to load. 

Now take what you've learned in the week 4 lecture and see if you can make the page load faster.
